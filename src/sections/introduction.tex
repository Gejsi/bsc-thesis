\label{chap:introduction}
% Briefly introduce the topic of serverless computing and its growing significance in modern software development.
% Mention the challenges and complexities developers face when working with serverless architectures.
Modern software development requires complex tooling to handle
all the concepts which surround the actual code and business logic.
Besides the actual program implementation, there are many components to consider
when thinking about all the moving parts needed to make software work
in today's dynamic environments, which are supposed to be scalable by design.

Traditionally, software was written in monolithic architectures where
the program's components are tightly coupled and tend to create
large codebases, as they provide heterogeneous functionalities under the same fa√ßade.
This paradigm, despite being the oldest, still has some benefits that
draw developers' attention especially in the early stages of the development lifecycle:
indeed, these architectures furnish the maximum amount of control over the infrastructure,
are easier to write because they do not need advanced orchestration mechanisms,
therefore simplifying testing and debugging.
Yet, the drawbacks of this paradigm were understood even in the past:
a case in point is the \textit{Unix} community, which moved away from it,
preferring a modular approach instead. Monoliths are hard to maintain, deploy,
adapt to changing requirements and technologies, and
become rigid quickly as reshaping its components may change involuntary bugs.
