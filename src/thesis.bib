              on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing
              resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and
              services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal
              management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model
              is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models
              , and four deployment models.},
